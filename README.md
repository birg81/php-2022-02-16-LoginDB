# php-2022-02-16-LoginDB
Hi guys. I developed this PHP code, for demonstration purposes.
This code simulates a login.
The code is written in PHP and MySQL.
I wrote a PHP script that allows you to automatically create the DB within the DBMS, if it is not already present (./UsersDB.sql.php).
I also wrote a configuration file (./config.inc.php), by modifying this file you can change the DB settings.
You shouldn't have too much trouble in tweaking the code and make everything work.
In case of difficulties, do not hesitate to contact me.

Good luck!
